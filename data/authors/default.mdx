# About Me ðŸ‘‹
Hi there, I'm Lebyy! I'm a student who loves writing code and exploring the endless possibilities of technology.

When I'm not busy coding or working on a development project, you can usually find me playing video games. I particularly enjoy games from the Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft series, and I love discovering new mods and game mechanics.

One of the things that inspires me the most in my coding journey is learning from other programmers. I always strive to improve my skills and expand my knowledge by studying the code of skilled developers like Androz2091, Archaeopteryx, Nico105, and many more.

My go-to tools for building projects are Node.js and TypeScript, which I find to be a powerful and efficient combination. I use these technologies to develop bots, open-source projects, and APIs. When it comes to databases, I prefer to work with MongoDB for its flexibility and scalability.

I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology. If you're interested in exploring the exciting world of coding and technology with me, feel free to connect and let's learn together!
