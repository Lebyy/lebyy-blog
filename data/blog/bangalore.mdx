üé≤ To make the most of our time on the train, we played some games, including dumsharads and uno. It was a great way to pass the time.

üõå We retired to our rooms, feeling satisfied and grateful for the wonderful experiences we had on our trip. As we drifted off to sleep, we reminisced about the beautiful sights, sounds, and flavors of Bangalore and looked forward to more adventures in the days to come.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Day 4
üí§ After a restful sleep, we woke up feeling refreshed and excited for another day of exploration in Bangalore. We started the day with a hearty breakfast and dressed up in our formal attire for our visit to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) headquarters.

üöÄ At ISRO, we learned about their missions, including the Chandrayaan 1 and Aditya-L1 missions. We were fascinated by the scaled-down replicas of the missions, which showed every single part used in the satellites, from the tiny semi-conductors to the fuel tanks. We also got to see the lab where an actual satellite was being manufactured. It was incredible to see the precision and detail that goes into creating these machines that explore the unknown depths of space.

üè≠ After our visit to ISRO, we went to the Visvesvaraya Industrial Technical Museum. The museum showcased the evolution of technology and industry in India. We saw exhibits that explained how engines work, and we were amazed by the space-related displays. We also saw some electrical-related exhibits and some animatronic dinosaurs that made us smile.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Day 5

üò¥ After a relaxing sleep, we woke up feeling a little sad that it was our last day in Bangalore. Nevertheless, we were excited to visit the RedHat office in Bangalore. As someone interested in open-source, I was particularly excited to learn about how RedHat, a large open-source organization, manages its projects and makes money.

We then made our way to the RedHat office, where we had an informative session with [Jai](https://github.com/invincibleJai) and [Saud](https://github.com/rottencandy). They shared insights into RedHat's workflow, licenses, security issues, and more. It was fascinating to see how an organization as large as RedHat manages its open-source projects.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Day 6
üöÇ Day 6 was spent entirely on the train ride back to Mumbai. We spent our time enjoying the scenery along the way and chatting with friends. We also ordered some delicious vegetarian thali food, which we enjoyed on the train.

üçΩÔ∏è The train ride was a great opportunity to reflect on our trip and share our favorite memories with each other. We were grateful for the chance to explore Bangalore and learn about its rich history and culture.

üëã Upon arriving back in Mumbai, we said goodbye to our teachers, friends, and the [Eduventura](http://www.eduventura.in/) team. We exchanged contact information with each other, promising to keep in touch and reminisce about our trip to Bangalore.

üôè We were grateful for the opportunity to participate in such an enriching and memorable trip. We had learned so much, made new friends, and created lasting memories that we would cherish for years to come. Until next time, Bangalore!
